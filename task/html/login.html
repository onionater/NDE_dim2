<p><b>Instructions</b></p>
<p>In this study, you will be reading a short passage about a character. You will then be asked to make a number of simple judgments about that passage (the passage will be shown for each question, so that you may reread if needed). There is no right or wrong answer, we are just interested in your opinion.</p>
<p>Once you have answered all questions about the passage, you will be given a choice to end and recieved payment, or to continue with additional passages (for additional compensation).</p>
<p>The data collected from this HIT will be used as part of a scientific research project. Your decision to complete this HIT is voluntary. We will not collect identifying information. Other than your responses, the only information we will have is the time at which you completed the survey and the amount of time you spent to complete it. Your data may be used in analyses presented at scientific meetings or published in scientific journals. Continuing with this study indicates that you are at least 18 years of age, and agree to complete this HIT voluntarily.</p>
<p>If you accept these conditions and are ready to begin, please fill in your Subject ID (provided in your MTURK HIT) and click below. By continuing, you are providing consent to participate in this study. </p>
